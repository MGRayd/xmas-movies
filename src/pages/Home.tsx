      <h2>The World of Terraveil</h2>
      <p>
      Twenty five years have passed since the Cataclysm split the world and the shrouding mists withdrew, 
unveiling a land long hidden: Terraveil. The disappearance of the mists has allowed entry into lands 
that were cut off from the rest of the world for over a century prior. In those years, bold settlers, 
soldiers, and seekers of fortune have pressed into its borders, raising towns upon ruins, charting 
forests once cloaked in secrecy, and daring the wilds where strange beasts and older magic's stir. 
Yet for all their efforts, most of Terraveil remains uncharted, and whispers speak of ancient powers, 
forgotten vaults, and kingdoms lost to both fire and fog. You are among those who would set foot where 
few dare tread — whether for glory, gold, knowledge, or reasons of your own. The roads into Terraveil 
are perilous, but the promise of discovery calls louder still. The mists may be gone, but mystery lingers, 
and fate waits for those bold enough to carve their story into the bones of this wild land.
